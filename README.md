📘 CleverBooks – Technical Screening Task

This repository contains my responses to the CleverBooks technical screening task, including written answers and a sample Laravel Blade component.

📁 Repository Contents

UserCard.blade.php
A reusable Laravel Blade component that displays user information using a hybrid styling approach:

Bootstrap classes for the card layout

TailwindCSS utility classes for text and badges
The component conditionally displays an “Admin” badge based on the user role.

answers.md
Written answers covering:

Laravel Mix vs Vite and hot module replacement

Coexistence of Bootstrap and TailwindCSS in a PostCSS pipeline

SQL join differences and indexing considerations

🧩 Notes & Assumptions

In a real Laravel application, the Blade component would be located at:
resources/views/components/user-card.blade.php

The code is intended to demonstrate structure, conventions, and understanding of the stack rather than serve as a runnable application.

No full Laravel environment was required for this task.
